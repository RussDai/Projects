    "### **1. Understand the Context:**\n",
    "- **Ask Questions**:\n",
    "  - What is the purpose of this dataset? \n",
    "  - Who collected it and why?\n",
    "  - What is the expected outcome of the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Review Documentation**:\n",
    "  - Look for a data dictionary or any accompanying documentation to understand the columns and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand the Domain**:\n",
    "  - If the dataset relates to a specific field (e.g., finance, healthcare), read about domain-specific metrics and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Dive Deep into the Dataset:**\n",
    "- **Start with a High-Level Overview**:\n",
    "  - Use `.info()` and `.head()` in `pandas` to look at the structure and sample data.\n",
    "  - Note the data types (`numerical`, `categorical`, `date-time`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Perform Basic Aggregations**:\n",
    "  - Use `.describe()` for numerical data.\n",
    "  - For categorical data, use `.value_counts()` to understand distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualize Columns Individually**:\n",
    "  - Use histograms for numerical data to see distributions.\n",
    "  - Use bar plots for categorical data to see frequencies.\n",
    "  - Use line plots for time-series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ask Yourself**:\n",
    "  - Which columns seem relevant?\n",
    "  - Are there patterns, anomalies, or surprising results?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Formulate Initial Hypotheses:**\n",
    "- Based on what you know:\n",
    "  - Are there relationships you expect to see? (e.g., \"Higher education leads to higher income.\")\n",
    "  - Are there trends or seasonality that should exist? (e.g., \"Sales peak during holidays.\")\n",
    "- Write down these assumptions, even if they’re vague—they will guide your next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Start Small with Questions:**\n",
    "Break the problem into small, manageable questions:\n",
    "- What are the most common values in this column?\n",
    "- What is the average or median value?\n",
    "- Is there any correlation between two columns?\n",
    "- Do the distributions differ between groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if analyzing sales data:\n",
    "- “What are the top-selling products?”\n",
    "- “Which regions contribute most to revenue?”\n",
    "- “Is there a seasonal trend in sales?”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Iterative Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Test Hypotheses**:\n",
    "  - Use filtering and grouping (`groupby()`) to check patterns. \n",
    "  - Use visualizations (scatter plots, box plots) to explore relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refine Hypotheses**:\n",
    "  - If initial patterns don’t match your expectations, ask why.\n",
    "  - Iterate: Try different groupings, aggregations, or visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Use EDA Frameworks:**\n",
    "Adopt frameworks to make your exploration systematic:\n",
    "- **Univariate Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Look at individual columns to understand distributions, ranges, and outliers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Bivariate Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Examine relationships between two variables using scatter plots, correlation coefficients, or crosstabs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Multivariate Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Use heatmaps, pairplots, or advanced techniques (e.g., PCA) to explore relationships between multiple features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Be Curious and Experimental:**\n",
    "- Treat the dataset like a puzzle:\n",
    "  - What story does it tell?\n",
    "  - What patterns are hidden?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow for trial and error:\n",
    "  - Sometimes insights come from unexpected plots or aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Learn from Examples:**\n",
    "- **Explore Public Datasets**:\n",
    "  - Analyze datasets from Kaggle or UCI ML Repository.\n",
    "  - Read through others’ notebooks to see how they approach analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practice Structured Approaches**:\n",
    "  - Follow tutorials that walk through data analysis step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Document Your Thoughts:**\n",
    "- Keep notes on:\n",
    "  - What you notice about the data.\n",
    "  - What questions come to mind.\n",
    "  - What actions you take and their results."
