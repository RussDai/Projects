    "Statistical hypothesis testing is a method of making decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data. It is a formal process to determine whether a hypothesis about a dataset is likely to be true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Key Concepts in Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**:\n",
    "   - A default assumption that there is no effect or difference in the data.\n",
    "   - Example: \"The mean usage time of `App A` is equal to `App B`.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**:\n",
    "   - The hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis, suggesting a significant effect or difference.\n",
    "   - Example: \"The mean usage time of `App A` is not equal to `App B`.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Significance Level (α)**:\n",
    "   - The threshold probability for rejecting the null hypothesis, often set at 0.05 (5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **p-value**:\n",
    "   - The probability of obtaining the observed results (or more extreme ones) if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "   - If `p-value < α`, reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test Statistic**:\n",
    "   - A numerical value calculated from the sample data that helps determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Steps in Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "1. Formulate the `null and alternative hypotheses`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose an appropriate `statistical test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compute the `test statistic` and `p-value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare the `p-value` with the `significance level (α)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Make a `decision` (reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Draw a conclusion based on the context of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Libraries Used for Statistical Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "Several Python libraries provide tools for statistical hypothesis testing. Here are the most commonly used ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`SciPy`:**\n",
