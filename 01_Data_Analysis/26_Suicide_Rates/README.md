# **Data Preparation:**
Some of the basic data preparation using Pandas and numpy is performed like:
**1. Understanding the Dataset Structure:**

**2. Cleaning Column Names and Renaming them if necessary**  

**3. Handleling Missing Values**

**4. Converting Data Types to their best possible dtypes**

**5. Standardize Categorical Values if necessary** 

**6. Remove or Fix Duplicatesfrom the dataset**

**7. Clean and Normalize Numeric Columns**

**8. Validate Data Consistency**

**9. Feature Engineering Readiness**

**10. Save the Cleaned Dataset and create a callablee function which outputs the dataset itself** 

These are some of the basic data preparation steps but further preparation may be required based on what we want to achieve.
