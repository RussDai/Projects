# **Data Preparation:**

### **1. Understand the Dataset Structure:**
**What to do:**  
Familiarize with the dataset’s structure, column names, data types, and how values are distributed. This gives us an overview of potential problems: missing data, inconsistent formats, strange characters, or outliers.

**How to perform:**  
- Inspect column names for inconsistencies (e.g., extra spaces).

- Check the number of unique values in each column.

- Review basic stats like min, max, mean, etc., especially for numerical columns.

- Scan for unusual characters in string-based columns.

---

### **2. Clean Column Names**  
Fix formatting issues in column names (e.g., leading/trailing spaces, special characters, inconsistent casing).

**Why it matters:**  
Unclean column names can cause errors in referencing them during analysis or code execution.

**How to perform:**  
- Strip extra spaces (e.g., `' gdp_for_year ($) '` → `'gdp_for_year'`).
- Rename for clarity and consistency (e.g., snake_case or lowercase format).

---

### **3. Handle Missing Values**
Identify and handle missing or null values in columns, especially in:
- `'HDI for year'` (frequently missing)
- Any other columns with gaps

**Why it matters:**  
Missing data can skew results, especially in statistical calculations or visualizations.

**How to perform:**  
- Quantify how many values are missing per column.

- Decide on a strategy:
  - **Drop** columns/rows if too many values are missing and they’re not crucial.
  - **Impute** with mean/median or a placeholder if the column is important.
  - **Leave as is** if it's not needed in your initial analysis.

---

### **4. Convert Data Types**
Ensure each column has the correct data type (e.g., numbers as integers/floats, dates as datetime).

**Why it matters:**  
Correct data types improve performance and ensure operations (e.g., sorting, aggregating) work correctly.

**How to perform:**  
- Convert `'year'` to an integer or datetime if needed.

- Convert GDP and population values to numeric after removing formatting characters.

- Ensure `'suicides_no'`, `'gdp_per_capita'`, `'population'`, and `'suicides/100k pop'` are numeric.

---

### **5. Standardize Categorical Values** 
Ensure consistent formatting in categorical columns like `'sex'`, `'age'`, `'generation'`, `'country'`.

**Why it matters:**  
Inconsistent labels (e.g., “Male” vs “male”) create duplicate categories and hinder grouping/filtering.

**How to perform:**  
- Convert all text to lowercase or title case consistently.

- Fix known spelling errors or formatting inconsistencies.

- Sort and visually inspect unique values in these columns.

---

### **6. Remove or Fix Duplicates**
Check for and remove duplicate rows or records.

**Why it matters:**  
Duplicates can inflate statistics or introduce bias in analysis.

**How to perform:**  
- Identify complete duplicates (same across all columns).

- Optionally check for partial duplicates (e.g., same country, year, age group).

---

### **7. Clean and Normalize Numeric Columns**
Some columns like `' gdp_for_year ($) '` contain commas or extra symbols which must be removed.

**Why it matters:**  
These formatting characters prevent proper conversion to numeric types.

**How to perform:**  
- Strip commas and symbols (like `$`, whitespace).

- Normalize formatting across all entries.

---

### **8. Validate Data Consistency**
Ensure logical consistency between related columns.

**Why it matters:**  
For example, `suicides/100k pop` should roughly equal `(suicides_no / population) * 100000`. If not, something might be wrong.

**How to perform:**  
- Recalculate derived metrics and compare with existing values.

- Flag rows with significant mismatches for further inspection.

---

### **9. Feature Engineering Readiness**
Although analysis comes later, prepare the data so it’s ready for creating new features when needed.

**Why it matters:**  
A clean foundation makes it easier to group by generation, age, or compare countries over time.

**How to perform:**  
- Ensure the `'country-year'` identifier is consistent.

- Verify that age ranges and generation categories make logical sense and are in order.

---

### **10. Save the Cleaned Dataset** 
After cleaning, save a version of the cleaned dataset.

**Why it matters:**  
Preserves your work and separates raw vs. processed data for transparency and repeatability.

**How to perform:**  
- Save in a new CSV/Parquet file.

- Keep both the original and cleaned versions documented.
