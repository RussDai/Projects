## **Overview:**
This project aims to do Exploratory Data Analysis on some popular real-world datasets and create insightful visualizations using Python and libraries like Metplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Numpy, Pandas and others.

This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience in data visualization, allowing users to gain insights from various datasets and present them in a visually appealing manner.

> So, the main aim is to do detailed analysis on different datasets with heavy visuallizations.

I utilize Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create a range of static and interactive plots that help in understanding and analyzing data effectively.

## **Tools Used:**
- **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis, manipulation and visualization.

- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative graphics.

- **Plotly**: An interactive graphing library that makes it easy to create web-based visualizations.

- **Numpy**: A library for numerical computing in Python.

- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.

## **Installation:**
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajesh-coventry/Projects/tree/master/02_Data_Visuallization
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
    ```

## **Possible Plots:**
This project includes a variety of plots, such as:

1. `Line Plots`: Visualize trends over time.

2. `Bar Charts`: Compare different categories.

3. `Histograms`: Show the distribution of a dataset.

4. `Box Plots`: Display the spread and identify outliers.

5. `Scatter Plots`: Explore relationships between two variables.

6. `Heatmaps`: Visualize matrix-like data.

7. `Pie Charts`: Show proportions of categories.

8. `Interactive Plots`: Create engaging visualizations using Plotly.

9. and many more.
